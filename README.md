## About this project
Part of the [Road to Metaverse, Creator Series](https://create.unity.com/road-to-metaverse), this demo was used in Episode 10 to learn how to build a simple IoT console and dashboard application using MQTT.

---

There are two scenes to explore

### Console 
- Listen to UI and Midi inputs
- Sends messages to broker
- Listen to messages from broker & updates UI + digital twin

### Dashboard
- Listen to messages from broker
- Updates UI and 3D Scene values
- No user inputs

The project uses the following resources:
- Fork of [M2MQTT for Unity](https://github.com/gpvigano/M2MqttUnity) by [Giovanni Paolo Vigan√≤](https://github.com/gpvigano)
- [MinisVS](https://github.com/keijiro/MinisVS) for midi support
- [Notifications for Visual Scripting](https://github.com/RoadToTheMetaverse/visualscripting-notifications)
